* Tasks
** Dig into fleet decisions [0/4]
   - [ ] How are discards handled when fleets are combined?
   - [ ] How are length compositions handled?
   - [ ] What ss3 inputs govern handling of discards?
   - [ ] What selectivities can differ and which mirrored?
** Setup report/ folder using csasdown [1/3]
   - [X] Setup report structure
   - [ ] Begin populating methods with preliminary decisions
   - [ ] Begin assembling visuals workflow
** Update input files [0/4]
   - [ ] Update starter
   - [ ] Update data
   - [ ] Update control
   - [ ] Update forecast
** Compare model choices [0/2]
   - [ ] Compare model choices to US assessment
   - [ ] Compare model choices to Canadian assessments
** Generate data figures [/]
** Fit base model [/]  
** Consider sensitivity analyses [/]
   - [ ] High historical catch 1876-1934 (Ketchen)
* Questions
** How does ss3 get from catch pieces to biomass?
** Include commercial landings 1876--1936?
** Include max early commercial landings sensitivity?
** Recreational dogfish lengths in GFBio?
** Reasonable to include unknown trawl in bottom trawl?
